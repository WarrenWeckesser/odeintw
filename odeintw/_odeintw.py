def odeintw(func, y0, t, **kwargs):
    """
    An odeint-like function for complex array-valued differential equations.

    The function `scipy.integrate.odeint` is a wrapper of the LSODA function
    for solving ordinary differential equations.  It is designed to handle
    a system of first order differential equations expressed as a vector
    function.  `odeint` does not handle equations with complex dependent
    variables, or array equations.

    `odeintw` is a wrapper of `odeint` that adds the ability to handle
    complex and array differential equations.  See the docstring of odeint
    for an explanation of its arguments.

    Unlike odeint, all arguments after the first three position arguments
    `func` (the system definition function), `y0` (the initial condition)
    and `t` (the time values) must be given as keyword arguments.

    Initial conditions
    ------------------
    The initial condition `y0` given to `odeintw` determines the type of the
    solution that is generated.  The data type and shape of the value
    returned by `func` must match those of the initial condition.

    If the solution is to be complex, the initial condition must be complex.
    To solve a complex differential equation with real initial conditions,
    give complex initial conditions with zero imaginary parts.

    Similarly, the shape of the solution of a matrix differential equation
    is determined by the shape of the initial condition.  For example, if
    the initial condition has shape (2,3), then `func` must return a numpy
    array (or something array-like) that has shape (2,3).

    Special handling of Jacobian arguments
    --------------------------------------
    The argument `Dfun` may be used with array equations.  If `shp` is the
    shape of the array, then the shape of the Jacobian array returned by
    `Dfun` must be ``shp + shp``.  For example, if the array is 2-d `F`,
        jac[m, n, i, j] holds dF[m,n]/da[i,j]

    `Dfun` may also be used with complex equations.  However, if the
    functions computed by `func` are not complex differentiable, the
    Jacobian function should not be used.  To use the Jacobian argument in
    this case, the equations should be rewritten as a system of real
    equations for the real and imaginary parts of the solution.  For
    example, the conjugation operation is not complex differentiable, so
    to use an explicit Jacobian for the complex scalar equation
        dz/dt = z.conj(),
    the equation must be written as
        dx/dt = x
        dy/dt = -y
    Then the Jacobian of the real system is [[1, 0], [0, -1]].
    If `Dfun` is not given as an argument, the system may be left as a
    complex differential equation.

    In the case of arrays with dimension 2 or more, the odeint arguments
    `col_deriv`, `ml` and `mu` can not be used.

    Complex array equations are handled, but to use `Dfun`, the same
    requirement on the complex differentiability of the components
    holds.
